 * Bridge between the in-process browser MCP tools (which call `send` from

 * fires (a hidden/closed webview can never hang the agent turn). `respond`
 * resolves whichever Deferred is keyed by `result.id`. `commands` is the
 * server→renderer broadcast every BrowserPane consumes.
 *
 * Deliberately ephemeral — no SQLite. A browser command only matters while
 * its agent turn is live; nothing survives a restart.
